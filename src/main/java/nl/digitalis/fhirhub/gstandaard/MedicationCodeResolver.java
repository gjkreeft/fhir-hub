/**
 * Resolves the patient's current medication to the full G-Standaard code set.
 *
 * <p>A host identifies a drug by one code, PRK or HPK. Prescriptor's medication surveillance
 * needs PRK and GPK together (plus HPK when the host had it), so each drug is looked up in the
 * {@code medcode} view of the G-Standaard database before the session is opened.
 *
 * <h2>Why this fails loudly</h2>
 * An unresolvable code aborts the session rather than opening one with an incomplete
 * medication list. Surveillance that silently receives fewer drugs than the patient is taking
 * does not fail visibly: it answers "no interaction found", which is a false negative in the
 * dangerous direction, and a prescriber cannot tell it apart from a genuine all-clear. So the
 * safe behaviour is to refuse and name the code that could not be resolved.
