 * The G-Standaard / NHG subsystem tokens the upstream XML dialect understands.

 * <p>These tokens end up as XML <em>attribute names</em> in the inner DigitalisRx document, so
 * they are validated against this allow-list before use. Without that, a caller-supplied code
 * system would be able to inject attributes.
 *
 * <p>They are the upstream vocabulary and nothing else. A token is never a {@code Coding.system}
 * on either side of this interface — it is not a URI — and {@code CodeSystemRegistry} is the one
 * place that maps between a token and the system URI that stands for it.
