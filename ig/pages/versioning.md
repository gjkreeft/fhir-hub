How this guide changes, and what you may build on. Agree the parts that affect your release
process with Digitalis before you go live.

### Where a version shows up

One number versions the whole guide. It is stamped on every artifact in it, so the version you
see in a validator message is the version of the guide that produced the profile:

```
None of the codings provided are in the value set 'ICPC-1 NL'
(http://spec.digitalis.nl/fhir/ValueSet/icpc-1-nl|0.1.0), ...
```

The running service does not carry a version anywhere in a request or a response: none in the
path, none in the payload, none in a header. A deployment implements one release of this guide,
and the way to ask which is `GET /fhir/metadata` — the `CapabilityStatement` reports it as
`software.version`, with `implementation.description` naming it alongside the canonical. That call
is unauthenticated, so you can check it before you hold credentials.

### Two addresses per artifact

Canonical URLs are **unversioned** and always resolve to the current release:

```
http://spec.digitalis.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/fhirhub-FormularySessionInput
```

That is the URL a payload carries, and the one to leave in your code. Every release is *also*
kept at a versioned path, permanently:

```
http://spec.digitalis.nl/fhir/0.1.0/StructureDefinition/fhirhub-FormularySessionInput
```

Point a validator at the versioned path when you want a build that cannot change under you, and
at the unversioned one when you want to find out early that it has. Both forms serve the same
bytes for the same release; a release is never edited in place, so a versioned URL is safe to
cache forever, and the current one is not.

Neither address changes what the running service accepts. Validating against 0.1.0 while the
service has moved to 0.2.0 will not fail — it will pass on the old rules, which is exactly the
kind of green run that verifies nothing. Track the version in `metadata`.

### What a version bump means

`major.minor.patch`, and the promise is about **payloads you already send**:

| | Meaning | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Patch** | Nothing changes about what is accepted or emitted: a payload that validated before validates now, and no response carries an element your parser has not seen | A clearer sentence, a corrected `description` or `comment` on a profile, a better example, a fixed link |
| **Minor** | Additive. Every request that was accepted before is still accepted, and every response you could already parse still parses | A new optional parameter; a new optional element; a widened `max`; a new code in a Digitalis-minted `CodeSystem`; a new accepted lab determination |
| **Major** | A payload that used to be accepted may now be rejected, or a response may carry something your parser has to be taught | A new required element; a narrowed binding; a removed or renamed parameter; a tightened cardinality; a changed canonical |

Note that a patch can still change the bytes of a `StructureDefinition`: an element's
`description` and `comment` live inside the profile, so correcting the wording of one alters the
artifact without altering a single rule. What a version number promises here is about behaviour,
not about checksums — if you need bytes that cannot move, pin the versioned path.

Two consequences worth stating outright, because they are the ones that surprise people:

**A minor release can still break you if you validate strictly outbound.** New optional elements
in a response are a minor change, and a client that rejects unknown elements will fail on one.
Ignore what you do not recognise — that is the FHIR rule and it is the rule here.

**A new parameter name is additive for the service and not for you.** Inbound parameter slicing
is closed, so a name the deployment you are talking to does not know is a 400 rather than an
ignored element (see [Conventions](conventions.html)). Do not start sending a parameter
introduced in a minor release until the deployment you call has moved to it, and read the version
out of `metadata` rather than assuming.

### While the status is `draft`

This guide is `draft` at 0.1.0, and `draft` is not a formality: **a breaking change can arrive at
a minor version** until the first `active` release. The three that are most likely, and the
change each would be:

- a decision about `meta.profile`, which nothing asserts today — see
  [Current limitations](limitations.html)
- a second eGFR determination, if Dutch laboratories start reporting MDRD or cystatin C — see
  [Lab determinations](lab-determinations.html)
- nl-core parentage, if the Nictiz artifacts this interface would need stop being pre-release

The version becomes `1.0.0` and the status `active` when the first integrator goes to production.
From that point the table above is a promise: breaking changes only at a major.

### Deprecation

Nothing is removed without warning. An element or code on its way out is marked deprecated for at
least one minor release, with what to use instead, and is removed at the next major at the
earliest. A deprecated element keeps working for as long as it is present.

### What is *not* covered by any of this

These can change in a patch release, so do not build on them:

- **Error wording.** `OperationOutcome.diagnostics` is written for a person. Branch on the HTTP
  status and on `expression`/`location`; never match on the text. See [Errors](errors.html)
- **The `url` from an open-session call.** Prescriptor's shape, not part of this contract.
  Redirect to it unchanged and read the session id from `sessionId`
- **`meta.profile`.** Not asserted on anything the service emits today. Do not route on it
- **HTML rendering.** `?_format=html` is a convenience for a browser, not an interface

### How you find out

Every release is listed on the [Changelog](changelog.html) with the version, the date and what
moved, and the versioned snapshot of the release it replaces stays online. Ask Digitalis to be
told directly — with a dozen HIS suppliers and several XIS systems, a changelog nobody is pointed
at is not an announcement.
