// The one code system Digitalis mints. The G-Standaard subsystems are NOT defined here, and
// must not be: a CodeSystem this IG defines is checked more strictly than one it does not
// know. The G-Standaard tables are licensed, so any definition would have to be
// content: not-present, which makes a value set including it unexpandable and turns every
// coding in it into an error. An entirely unknown system falls to
// UnknownCodeSystemWarningValidationSupport and becomes a warning instead, which is the only
// way a required binding onto a licensed table can be satisfied. TerminologyEnforcementTest
// pins that.
//
// BST401T rubriek 72 is different: it defines exactly these three Opiumwet codes, so it can be
// content: complete. Prescriptor reports only a yes/no today, so fhir-hub emits only code 2.

// Value sets.
//
// Every one of these binds the SYSTEM rather than the code: the G-Standaard tables are
// licensed and enormous, they are not distributed with these profiles, and so a validator can
// check only that the coding comes from a system this interface routes. That is exactly the
// check SessionParametersMapper performs.
//
// There is exactly ONE accepted system per subsystem, and it is a URI. The upstream tokens
// ("SSK", "PRK", "ICPC", ...) are XML attribute names in the DigitalisRx document, not
// identifiers a caller may put in Coding.system, so neither these bindings nor
// CodeSystemRegistry accept one — with or without runtime validation. Blessing the token here
// would put a non-FHIR identifier on the wire permanently, and it would be the form a host
// discovers first.

// The list is closed, and it is short because the G-Standaard's own list is: BST685T rows with
// THMFBP = 2000 are the complete set of patient measurements an MFB rule can test — twelve of
// them, four used by current rules — plus weight and height, which dose checking reads. A lab
// value outside this set is not merely unused: accepting it would tell a prescriber their lab
// data had been weighed when nothing looked at it.
//
// Enumerated rather than "include codes from system http://loinc.org", so the binding says which
// codes are meant. fhir/LabDeterminations.java carries the same list with the MFB parameter each
// code feeds, the caption sent when a host supplies no display, and the units it accepts;
// LabDeterminationsTest pins the two together.
